# Insurance Premium Prediction with FastAPI

## 📌 Introduction

This project is a **Machine Learning application** built using **FastAPI** that predicts insurance premiums based on customer details such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. The backend is powered by FastAPI, making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy, while the model is trained on historical insurance data.

The application can be accessed via REST API endpoints as well as a simple UI for interaction.
